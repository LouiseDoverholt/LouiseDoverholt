- 👋 Hi, I’m Louise Doverholt!
- 👀 I’m interested in finding candidates (yes, I'm one of those darn recruiters).
- 🏡 I currently work as a Talent Acquisition Consultant at Home of Recruitment which means the companies I recruit for can vary from time to time.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to find and network with people within tech via Github.  
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at louise.doverholt@homeofr.se or my linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-doverholt/
